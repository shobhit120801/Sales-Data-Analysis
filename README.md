This project utilizes Python Pandas and Matplotlib to analyze a year's worth of sales data from an electronics store, tackling tasks like data cleaning and exploration. 
Initially, NaN values are dropped, rows are filtered based on conditions, and column types are adjusted. Following data cleaning, the exploration phase delves into five key business questions:

Identifying the most profitable month and its revenue.
Determining the city with the highest sales.
Optimizing advertisement timing for maximizing sales.
Finding frequently co-purchased products.
Identifying the top-selling product and reasons behind its success.
To address these questions, various Pandas and Matplotlib functionalities are employed, including concatenation of CSV files, column manipulation using string parsing, the apply() method for custom operations, groupby for aggregation, and plotting bar charts and line graphs for visualization, all with appropriate labeling.
